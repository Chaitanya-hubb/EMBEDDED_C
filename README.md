# Embedded C Projects

## Description
This repository contains simple Embedded C programs for PIC microcontrollers.

## Projects
1. 01_LED_BLINK.c - Blink all LEDs on PORTB
2. 02_LED_BLINK.c - Alternate blinking of first 4 and last 4 LEDs on PORTB

## Microcontroller
- PIC series (XC8 compiler)

## Features
- GPIO configuration using TRIS register
- Software delay using __delay_ms()
- Watchdog Timer disabled
- 
## Notes
- The program was written and built using **MPLAB X IDE**.  
- The program logic was tested using **PicSimLab** simulator.
